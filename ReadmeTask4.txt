Depending on which script you wish to run for the proxy, place that pearl script in the
folder /home/seed.

The script file must be named myprog.pl (to specify which script is which the files were renamed)


in the terminal in the directory /etc/squid3 enter: sudo service squid3 restart in the terminal
